# Technical training

This directory contains all projects, one in each sub directory:

- Android
- Unreal Engine
- Web
- Windows Phone

## Environment

If you want to work on your own project, be careful to work on your specific branch and not on other's branches!

- android-master
- unreal-engine-master
- web-master
- windows-phone-master

If you want to use several branches, please create branches using your own project `id`, as the following: `android-engine`, `web-fix-scrolling` and so on to make sure they're yours.


## Web application

Please read the documentation at `Web/README.md`.

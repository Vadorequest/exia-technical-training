# Schemas
The schemas are the files used by **mongoose** to deal with the database.
They contain mostly rules about a collection. (~table)

They are shared because the **web server** DAO need to have access to them
to perform the validation through the validator. *(__validator global)*

**Please take example on the way the schemas aer written in the Translate application.**
